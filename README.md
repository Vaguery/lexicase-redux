# lexicase-redux

A Clojure library that explores and tries to replicate some of the inner algorithms of [Lee Spector's Clojush](https://github.com/lspector/Clojush) system for genetic programming. Also trying to learn some useful [Midje practices](https://github.com/marick/Midje). Also also doing some remote collaboration with [Nic McPhee](https://github.com/NicMcPhee).

## Usage

This is looking like it'll end up as a bunch of interactive design spikes.

1. navigate to project directory
2. `lein repl`
4. `(use 'midje.repl)`
5. `(autotest)`
6. edit the source code in `src/lexicase_redux/core.clj`
7. when you save anything, `midje` will run all the tests for you
